### 3.2. Incorrect Username or Email Address

If you receive an error saying your username or email address is incorrect, double-check for any typos in your email address. Ensure there are no spaces before or after the username and that you are using the correct domain (e.g., @aol.com).

If you have multiple AOL accounts, make sure you are entering the correct username associated with the account you wish to log into.

### 3.3. Account Locked

AOL may temporarily lock your account if there have been too many unsuccessful login attempts or if it suspects suspicious activity. If your account is locked, try waiting for a few minutes before trying again. Alternatively, you can reset your password to regain access.
